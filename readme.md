# WIP Wilde

## Introduction

The goal for this project is to be a distributed message broker
implemented using cap'n proto rpc.

This is not currently intended for production use.

## Examples

Examples can be build using the following cargo commands:

```bash
cargo build --examples
```

The server is not fully implemented yet so running them won't work.
